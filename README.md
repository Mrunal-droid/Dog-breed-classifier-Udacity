# Dog-breed-classifier-Udacity

# The Libraries used
1. Sklearn
2. Numpy
3. Keras
4. Random
5. cv2
6. Matplotlib

# Motivation of the project
Dog breed classifier project is a part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree program. In this project, the classification was done using CNN algorithm.

- The project was build on CNN algorithm starting from scratch.
- The project was then build using the transfer learning models.

# File description

The Jupyter notebook showcases the skills of building a classifier model with two ideas and evaluate which model yeilds better results. The databases are provided by Udacity.

1. Data set of 13233 images.

# Summary of the results

- The CNN build from scratch gives a very low accuracy and does not perform well on test set.
- The CNN build of pre-trained models of VGG and Resnet50 have high accuracy percentages of 45% and 80% respectively.
